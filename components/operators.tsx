          The Government of the Republic of Namibia through the Petroleum
          (Exploration and Production) Act of 1991 empowered the Minister of
          Industries, Mines and Energy to enter into agreements with individual
          oil exploration companies granted exploration licenses in Namibia
          requiring them to contribute an agreed amount of money to PETROFUND.
          As a result, PETROFUND's funding is sourced from petroleum exploration
          license holders. Clause 22 of the Petroleum Agreement outlines the key
          provisions regarding the employment and training of Namibians.
